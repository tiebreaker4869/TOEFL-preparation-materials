## Travel

I 'm a big fan of travelling. Since I believe travelling can push me to broaden my horizon and see the world in a different way.

The problem of always being in the same place for a long time is that my world might get smaller.

So when I have time or money (有钱/有时间/因为 ... 省了时间/挣了钱), I will go to a different place to travel, and I can always experience something that I will never experience in my hometown/ if I keep staying in the campus all the time. And I can always be a better person afterwards.

## Internet

The Internet makes my daily life convenient for following reasons.

First, I believe that it is the easiest and cheapest source of entertainment. With a computer in front of me, I can play games, listen to music and watch the latest shows on demand. With the help of the Internet, I 'm always satisfied. 

Second, the Internet simplifies communication. For example, it used to take my mom days to receive a letter from my dad, who used to work in a faraway place. But unlike that generation, the only thing I need to do whenever I miss my friends or relatives is to give them a face-time call on my phone, and I can not only hear their voice, but also see their smiling faces within seconds, which is really convenient as well as time-saving.

## Friend & Group Work

I prefer to spend time with my family and friends for 2 reasons.

First, it is a good way for me to relax -- talking with them usually helps me relieve stress, which in turn leaves me energized for the next day. And I can usually have a better study efficiency this way.

Second, my family and friends can be a good source of help with my studies. For instance, I'm not good at history. So whenever I struggle to understand how an important historical event affects the present, my family and friends can lend a hand.

For these 2 reasons, I prefer to spend time with my family and friends.

## Friends: some building blocks

Peer influence can be very strong. People share similar interests with their friends and spend a lot of time with them in daily life. Therefore, they will often listen to opinions from each others. For instance, when I have some troubles with my work, I will discuss with my friends, and I can always find solutions in this way.

People can feel more relaxed with the accompany of  their friends. Most people will be nervous if they are surrounded by total strangers. But if they come with their friends, they will feel more comfortable.

People can share feelings about the movies or concerts with their friends. For example, last year I went to cinema with my friends, and after the movie finished, I discussed the content of the movie with my friends, and it was also great fun.

## Study life and childhood building blocks

When I was a child, I didn't need to worry abut my scores, my future and so on. But now I am very anxious about my academic performance in university.

When I was a child, I had a lot more time to play. However, I am very busy with my studies now, and I have a lot of courses to take,  tons of assignments to do. Therefore, I almost have no time to play.

## Save money

I prefer to save money if I have a little extra money.

I feel this way for two reasons.

First, this can prevent wasting money. If I spend money right away buying whatever I want. I may end up buying things that I don't truly need. And this can be a waste of money.

Secondly, saving money can cultivate good financial habit. I will save the extra money in the bank and earn more interests. Afterwards, I can use the money to buy things that I truly need after careful consideration. 

## Job interview

If one of my friends were going to give a presentation, I would give him two suggestions.

First, practice makes perfect. He should familiarize himself with the materials he is going to talk about and focus on the reason for giving the presentation.

Like once, when I had to give a talk in front of a large group of students. At the beginning, I was nervous, but then I realized that it was just practice, and practicing is a good way to build confidence. Remembering that, I relaxed, and you know what, my talk was a success.

Second, I would tell my friend  to take a training course. In a training course, he can get help from professional teachers. His problems can be resolved then and there. With those teachers' help, it would be easy to give a successful presentation.

Those are my two suggestions.

## Tree

I want to plant trees in a park for the following two reasons.

First, planting trees protects the environment. Since trees can absorb carbon dioxide, conserve water, and prevent soil erosion.

Second, I just want to give people more opportunities to relax. You know, being surrounded by trees is always beneficial to one's mental health. And wandering in a park abundant with trees can provide one with the perfect opportunity to reflect on his daily struggles and successes.

After all, fantastic scenery always has a way of relieving people's stress and making their lives more manageable.

## Relax & Make Friends

Personally speaking, the XXX I like is ...

First, it is a good way for me to take a break from studying.

You know, as a student, I'm very busy with my studies. Whenever I feel exhaustive after a whole day's study and tired of learning my major subjects, doing ... is a good way for me to release my stress.

Second, I think usually a lot of my friends can be made by doing ...

I can always meet different people with similar interests. Since a lot of friends around me are interested in ... we can always have a lot of common topics to share with each other, and we can usually have a lot of fun.

For these two reasons, .....

## Shopping

I prefer to go shopping in a large store for following reasons.

First, it is very convenient. You know, as a student, I'm very busy with my studies. Shopping in a large store helps me save time.

Cuz a large store has a large selection, giving me the opportunity to buy all of my goods at the same time. And I can use the time I save to study more.

Second, since a large store's products are cheaper, shopping in a large store saves my money. You know, for me, I don't have much money, all my money comes from my parent.

So I would rather use the money I save by shopping at a large store to buy more useful books to enrich my knowledge and improve the academic performance in the final exam.

## Work Ethic

Personally, I think a good work ethic is the most important quality to a university student.

It might be true that intelligence yield twice result with half the effort, but it is never the guarantee of success. In fact, the world is full of gifted failures.

The case also applies to highly motivated students. Motivation doesn't necessarily result in follow through.

The greatest predictor of being a successful university student is how many hours are devoted to a goal. I believe the more students practice a skill, the better they will become at what they are trying to accomplish.

It is always hard work supporting their natural talent that guarantees life-long success.

## Beijing

For example, Beijing -- the capital city of China.

Every year when it comes to winter, Beijing will suffer from very serious air pollution.

The poor air quality outside has not only brought us inconvenience of not being able to do outdoor exercise, but it has also become one of the reasons that will contribute to some of the serious illnesses such as lung cancer and heart disease.

So we should (/not)



## Convenient

Computers have changed our life tremendously in so many ways.

First of all, computers/cellphones have made it easier for us to search for information.

For example, whenever I have some questions and wanna find out the answer, the only thing I need to do is to put the key words of my question into the search engine like google, and the information I need will appear on the screen within seconds, which is really convenient as well as time-saving.
